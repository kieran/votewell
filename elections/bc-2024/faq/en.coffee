      <Qna question="What is this?">
        <p>There are 2 provincial parties in BC with leftist politics, and only one that is right-leaning. This often causes a "split vote" among leftist voters, giving the right an over-representation of electoral seats.</p>
        <p>To "un-split" the vote, this tool tells you if strategic voting is necessary in your riding, and if so, which party is the leading choice.</p>
      </Qna>

      <Qna question="What is strategic voting?">
        <p>Strategic voting is essentially a manual version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting">ranked ballot</a>, where your vote counts towards your top choice that could win.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_reform#Canada">Electoral reform</a> (promised in the 2015 federal election) would do this automatically, making this tool obsolete.</p>
      </Qna>

      <Qna question="What if I want the Conservatives to win?">
        <p>You should vote Conservative! Since there’s no split on the right, this tool is not necessary.</p>
