      <Qna question="What is tactical voting?">
        <p>Tactical voting is essentially a manual version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Alternative Vote</a>, where your vote counts towards your top choice that could win.</p>

          would automatically have representation reflect the vote, making this tool obsolete.

        <p>You should vote Conservative! Since there’s no significant split on the right, this tool is not necessary.</p>
